        <h2>Music for my Elephants</h2>

        <p class="firstParagraph">But as they crossed the desert, each time they thought they found a cache of musical instruments, it was invariably a mirage, or the ruins of an old euphonium, long since filled in with sand. The elephants grew dispondent. The music they'd brought with them had long since run out, but every so often, one of them, mad with fever, would try whistling 'call me maybe', or 'shape of you'. The others, embarrassed, would turn away as the madman blew soundlessly through his cracked lips.</p>
        <p>Once they had found a small plane, crashed and deserted. Wild and feverish, they had turned on the radio and listened to 97.7 The Edge until morning, all crowded into the tiny cabin. But their hollow ears could not handle the hard riffs and soulful crescendos after so long in the desert, and the next day the few who were still alive left the many who were not in the Cessna, still listening to Havana as the batteries ran down.</p>
        <p>They eyed each other, knowing that before nightfall there would be blood on the dunes as knives tried to make flutes of leg bones and arm bones.</p>
