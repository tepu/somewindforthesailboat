        <h2>Pogies</h2>

        <p class="firstParagraph">we'd get near the crick and start smelling the pogies from the pogie factory and I'd get so hungry all I'd be able to think about was eating pogies. When we got older, Jo got a job at the pogie factory and she'd stick her whole hand in the hot pogie liquid and spend a whole day licking the pogie off, because the warm pogie would coat her hand and it would take hours to lick it all off. She'd lick her had until it bled to make sure she got all the delicious pogie. Some pogies come in a big glass jar, to keep the pogie fresh, but you can get them in a paper box too. We got our pogies in paper boxes, because they'd be gone lickity-split. Once when Tobbi and me were on the bridge over the crick near the pogie factory Garther McComb took our pogies and set them on fire right in front of us. All we could do was watch the pogies burn, and they smelled so good, i went wild thinking about eating those burning pogies. Some of my earliest memories was of grandma taking the pogies into the bathroom with her. She'd have her pogies in the tub while she did her warshin up, and we could all five of us smell pogies through the whole house. We'd have pogies every Christmas. Once my mum had set the table, but before we got called to say grace me and buck ran up the table, filled our shirts with pogies and ate them behind the house. If Grandma and Grandpa were coming over, ma would put the pogies in special pogie dishes made of silver. Once, when we went to the Anglican church in Tupelo and they had pogies right in the chapel, there were pogie drippings all over the floor. One of the altar boys was even carrying a pogie while he followed the priest. The worst day of my life was when yankee candle moved the pogie factory to mexico where they could pay folks less to make pogies. </p>
