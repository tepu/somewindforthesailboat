        <h2>The Amazing Conversations of Mssr. Henri Collet</h2>

        <p class="firstParagraph">"Oh, you really must stay for dinner" the Marchioness Leduc insisted "We're having Henri Collet over, I've told you about him. That absolutely waggish chap I met shooting in Nantes."</p>
        <p>"I can't say I recall" I replied, overjoyed to have a reason to stay as the Marchioness had so cordially offered me the chaise closest to the drink cart. Whatever I may have felt regarding being on my third Bordeaux since luncheon evaporated remembering she was on her third Anatolian tan of the year.</p>
        <p>"One aspect of Henri's character that I can't stress enough, indeed the only aspect worth mentioning is the man's sheer talent for understatement. His capacity for it is unbounded, it makes him absolutely drôle."</p>
        <p>That evening after we had dressed for dinner, but before the repas itself, I had retired for a brief Turkish cigarette and a volume of Defoe with which I was becoming only just acquainted when the footman presented Henri to the Marchioness and myself.</p>
        <p>"This is certainly a little hill you live on" Henri said to the Marchioness, who burst into uproarious laughter at this.</p>
        <p>"Did I not tell you William that this man has an unbridled taste for understatement?" the Marchioness said smiling, "this is the tallest mountain in the country!"</p>
        <p>Henri continued "I had a spot of the malbec you're so fond of, it was every bit as divine as you promised"</p>
        <p>"A spot!?" shouted the Marquis, still dressed from riding, coming up the hall, "you've seen the bottom of at least two bottles today. William, doesn't Henri have a fabulous talent for understatement?"</p>
        <p>Henri took this compliment jovially. "You should send your valet de pied to my carriage, there is a bottle of cabernet franc in my valise I think we should open now that the four of us are all together. You know William, I have a few vines around my château."</p>
        <p>"A few vines! My word" exclaimed the Marchioness "back at it again, indefatigable. Mssr. Collet, I know for a fact you have nearly two thousand acres under the plow."</p>
        <p>"I've seen it myself!" the Marquis added "Nine different terroirs, and he calls it 'a few vines'. You are truly the Molière of understating a situation, Henri."</p>
        <p>"I understand you were here for tiffin, William, how did you find the tuck?" the Marquis asked. The Marquis was a big game man, and an army man before that. In lieu of spectacles, he saw the world through the tasty prism of dinner. A slice of ham was the only corrective lens he ever used. Getting a feel for the sport, I tried my hand at understatement.</p>
        <p>"I had but a single grain of rice." I said, smiling.</p>
        <p>The silence was immediate. The Marchioness looked aghast, the Marquis furious.</p>
        <p>"God, Bill, you've really shit the bed this time, haven't you."</p>
