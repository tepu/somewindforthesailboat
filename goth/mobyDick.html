        <h2>Moby Dick for Goths</h2>
        <p><i>An abridged version of Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, edited by a program which enjoys only the lurid and morose.</i></p>

        <div class="poem">
            The ribs and terrors in the whale,<br>
            Arched over me a dismal gloom,<br>
            While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,<br>
            And lift me deepening down to doom<br><br>
            I saw the opening maw of hell,<br>
            With endless pains and sorrows there;<br>
            Which none but they that feel can tell--<br>
            Oh, I was plunging to despair.<br>
        </div>

        <p class="firstParagraph">Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. 'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!  Drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick! Terrors of the terrible! They have no good blood in their veins. But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with him?  But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward; Shame upon all cowards--shame upon them! There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.  Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation. And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body?</p>
        <p>So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.</p>
        <p>In what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together? A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Is all this agony so vain? That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him.</p>
        <p>Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them--\"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them." At length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.</p>
        <p>Base little Pip, he died a coward; died all a'shiver. No sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. And who are hearsed that die on the sea? It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he's bound to hell.</p>
        <p>It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. As one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught to staunch it. "Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable. Oh, lonely death on lonely life! You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg. But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away. Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers. Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress.</p>
        <p>As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews. The whale was now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades. That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults! I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over. But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.</p>
        <p>But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.</p>
