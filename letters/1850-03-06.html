        <h2>Leeds, March 6th, 1850</h2>
        <p class="noIndent">Dear Mother,</p>
        <p>We take this favourable opportunity of writing these few lines to you, but with sorrow and grief since we heard of the death of our Dear Departed Father & your dear companion in life, but we trust he is better than if he remained with us. Always we hope that his soul is with them that made him, in glory everlasting.</p>
        <p>Dear Mother, we thought it very hard of you for not writing to us a few days after he departed this life but it is better late than never. You were all together but we were here forlorn not knowing, nor does not know whether our Dear Father asked for us or our Children his blessing or not. Which we say whether it was your fault, or the fault of them who write the letters to us, <span class="annotation judy">[Could Annabella write?]</span> that was all the treasure we wanted to get.</p>
        <p>Dear Mother, we hope that you will take council and comfort from that God that separated you and him in this world, to meet in the Kingdom of Heaven where parting will be no more, and that is the prayer of your Dear Children. May he who bought you and us with such a price as his precious Blood enable you and us to press forward to the mark and prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus our Lord, and if we never meet in this world, we hope we shall meet in our Father's Kingdom where we shall part no more, Amen.</p>
        <p>Amen</p>
        <p>Dear Mother, we would like to know how our Dear Departed Parent has settled you in this unfriendly world, and where you are living now at present or did you get any world from Ireland lately, and if you think you would be more comfortable down here than where you are, you will send us word and then we will send you directions how to proceed, as the journey is far. If you came down you could not expect to get back. Further you will send us a particular account of how Henry <span class="annotation judy">[brother]</span> and Francis and all the rest of the family is in health at present, and further you will let us know how long the sickness of our Dear Father lasted, and what disease he had, and if he suffered much pain. Anne never got such bad health since she came up to this part of the country as she does now at present, but the rest of the family is well and for our present we are all in good health, all inquiring friends is well.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Ennett in company with James A Kison has brought three hundred acres of land within two miles of this place in the township of Pittsburgh and young Thomas Cannon has bought land here within half a mile. All our children and grand-children send their love to you and all the families which you make a part.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">No more at present,<br>But remain your affectionate children till Death,<br>Thos & Elisabeth Boddy</p>
        <p>P.S. The market here is very reasonable. N.B. - You can let Charles Conner know that his mother is well, and in good health at present</p>
