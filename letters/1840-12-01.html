        <h2>Mohill 1st December, 1840</h2>

        <p class="noIndent">Dear Mick</p>
        <p>I have very often made inquiry respecting you and your family without getting any satisfactory acct. except having heard that your family and yourself enjoy good health, which I hope is the case, and also that you have cause to be pleased with the changes you have made, indeed I think nothing can be worse than Ireland is at present, the smaller class of farmers are getting poorer and poorer every day, and you must have heard of the murders of protestants that are daily committed even in this country, which you know had been so quiet. How all this will end God only knows.</p>
        <p>Your mother-in-law who is now living with Winslow Scanlon I am told enjoys good health, I have not seen her for some time. --- Duck who purchased <span class="annotation ben">your?</span> interest died a few months ago, and it's now held by his widow.</p>
        <p>There are some lives of leases under Sir Morgan Croftan who are in America and of whom I am desirous to obtain information, and if you without putting yourself to any trouble could tell me whether they or any heirds be living would geel greatly obliged and I send a list of them on the other side. I had a severe illness last spring which has shook me very much, and <span class="unknown">?</span> feel <span class="unknown">? ? ? ? ?</span> quickly, you and I mick are now very different from the time we were fellow soldiers in the yeomanry and we should consider that very soon we must leave this world, and should therefore prepare for another and I trust a better one. I send on the other side a list of the lives I wish you to enquire after, but as I have said already I do not wish you to put yourself to any trouble beyond asking about them when opportunities offer, and I would be glad to hear from you when you have heard anything respecting them.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">I am, Dear Mick, yours sincerely,</br>Berry Norris</p>
        <p>If you know anything about John Hurst of Gurrane or William Body from the same land, I should be very glad to heard of them, as they are persons for whom I have a great regard. James Hurst, who if now living is about 65 years and his brother William about 61, they were both sons of old Thomas Hurst of Gurrane, who went to America about 45 years ago. I was told some years back that one or both of them were settled at Brockville near Elizabethstown Upper Canada</p>
        <p>Thomas McGuire of Gurrane who you must have known very well and who has been several years in America (I think in Upper Canada) his wife I know died since they went there and he married the widow of -- Grogan, formerly of Ross <span class="unknown">Lough?</span>. I think he lived also at Brockville.</p>
        <p>John Medly, son of Thomas Medly of Gurrane, who went to Canada some years ago. Michael Body, Son of John Body, of Treanmore, who is settled somewhere in Canada.</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">from private ship</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">This letter addressed to Mr Michael Ogletree
        </br>Woolford near Brockville
        </br>Upper Canada
        </br>Postmarked Brockville Jan. 16. 1841
        </br>Also stamped Mohill Dec 1 - 1840
        </p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">Other post marks too dim to read. Some of the words are too faded to be sure of. Berry Norris was a friend of Great Greandfathers, a lawyer I think, I have copied as near as I could to show something of conditions and way of writing in Ireland at that time. Also because it is the earliest dated letter I can find.</p>
