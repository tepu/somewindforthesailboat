        <h2>Lurga, Mohill 24th June, 1874</h2>
        <p class="noIndent">My Dear Cousin</p>
        <p>I should long since have answered your letter which I received on 30th april last -  but we were under some excitement here as my son and eldest daughter Winslow and Jane Scanlon sailed for Melbourne in Australia on the 4th June in the ship Great Britain. My son was a clerk in the London North Western Railway Company in Liverpool in England for some time past, but was not satisfied with his situation though having a good salary, but he had some duties to perform on the Sabbath as there came 100 trains into the station every 24 hours. He came home here on a visit last January and told his sisters and brothers that he intended to go out to Australia and I did not hear anything of it until he wrote to his sister early in May that he had half his passage paid and intended starting on 4th June. his sister then requested to be let go out with him, as she was greatly attached to him and as we could not presuade him to remain at home. We thought they would be company to amounts of money out of it, but there is no getting of land here - according to your wishes I will give you a history of my family and my sisters.</p>
        <p>I have three sons - Winslow, Francis, and William, and six daughters - Jane, Elizabeth, Ellen, Charlot, Efsy, and Mary Anne. My sister Efsy who was married to Alexander Percival who resided within a mile of my Father's place has I believe ten children. The eldest son, Francis Percival and all his sisters is I believe in the United States of America, I believe in New York, for some years past. My other sister Charlot, who was married to James Pearce, had five children -  3 sons and 2 daughters, John Pearce, George Pearce, and James Pearce, daughters Elizabeth Pearce, and Efsy Pearce, two of the sons are married, one a farmer and the other a draper. One of the daughters married to a man the name of O'Hiel and is now I understand a traveling agent for a wine and spirit merchant in Canada. I was speaking a few days ago to James Ogletree and his mother whose health is a good deal improved and he says he never intends to die till he sees you <span class="unknown"> line cut off </span>
        <p>This Dobson was 23 years in state of Ohio. Mrs. Scanlon is quite recovered of her broken leg and is strong at present, as ever it was, and not the least lame.</p>
        <p>Hoping that Mrs. Ogletree and all your family are well and also all my cousins and their families are in good health. Hoping you will remember me to them all. I remain, my Dear Cousin, yours affectionately,
        <br>Francis Scanlon</p>
