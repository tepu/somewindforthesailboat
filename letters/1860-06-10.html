        <p class="noIndent">Dear Sister, <p class="annotation ben">Annabella Ogletree</p></p>
        <p>I send you these few lines hoping to find you in good health as this leaves me and Winslow and all my children at present. I am just nearly recovered with God's help of cancer in my foot, which has been unwell with me for the last twelve years and not knowing what it was until very lately when a man convenient to Longford undertook to cure it, which he has just done at the end of 3 months this the assistance of God.</p>
        <p>Provision is at present very reasonable in this country. Potatoes 3 shillings per Cwt. 8 stone. ? 14 shillings per Cwt. 8 stone. Butter 10d. per lb. Beef 6d. per lb. Mutton 7d. per lb. Indian meal 9 shillings per Cwt. 8 stone</p>
        <p> I am expecting to hear that you and your children and numberous grand-children are all well. The old people in mohill are all nearly gone. Captain Walsh and his sister have died this last year. Patt Galaher and Betty Galaher are also very poorly. No more at present. We send our love to you and all your children and grandchildren and pray that God may prosper you all, Amen</p>
