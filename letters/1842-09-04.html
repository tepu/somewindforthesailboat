        <h2>Drimure 4th September, 1842 <span class="annotation judy">(Extinct) (Longford is the nearest post office)</span></h2>

        <p class="noIndent">Dear Daughter and Son in law,</p>
        <p>I write these few lines to you hoping to find you in good health as this leaves me at present, thank God for it.</p>
        <p>I have received your letter yesterday and alas the letter you wrote the 15th April 1842 and would have answered it immediately but Johney Ogletree was speaking to me two or three times, and I showed him the letter you wrote to me and he said he was going to write on some of those days and I thought that quite sufficient. The last time I was speaking to him, I asked him did he write and he said he did not but that he would write in a few days after. This was on 1st July 43 and I suppose he wrote to you before this.
        <p>This is the third letter I have received from you the first directed to Ms. Norris written the 15th April 1842 and the second directed also to Ms. Norris written September 18th, 1842 but it is the last he will receive from you for he’s Dead since 1st September 42, which leaves me a little discontented on account of having my money with him, and they have not settled things yet on account of some disagreement amongst themselves and also on account of the two Daughters getting married, the one to parson Crofton, that is young Duke's son, and the other to Doctor West of Cloon, but I am expecting my part from them immediately, as there is some sign of an Administrative, but for the future I think it would be best to direct them to myself to Drimure, Longford.
        <p>As to our Country its not so much disturbed as you may think by the Repealers altho Mr. O’connell has had meetings in every County in Irland and also in Longford with the Revd. Doctor Kriggins at his side and also all the Clergy and even all it being on the Sabbath Day the poor rates of this Country are very heavy as they have to pay 10 ? a £ for whatever their land is values to yearly by a government Inspector.
        <p>The crops indeed is pretty good but the price is likely to very low on account of some bills passed in parliament on last allowing foreign beef and also foreign grain to come in a great deal cheaper than we can have it. <span class="annotation judy">Corn Laws</span>
        <p>I am rejoyced to hear of you having so many Grandchildren as age is creeping upon you. As for Johny Ogletree, the last time I saw him he was in good health and also his wife and his family. Notty Meakin and Morgan Meakin and his wife and daughter are all dead, I suppose you have heard of Wilson Scot's death.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">I remain yours Truly,</br>Ann Scott</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Dear Brother and Sister Michial and Annabelle Ogletree,</p>
        <p>We are much rejoiced to hear of you being in good health and also to hear of you having so many grandchildren. Our Daughter Annabella is insane this 5 years, and very little sign of her getting any better.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Yours very Truly,</br>Winslow, Elizabeth Scanlon <span class="annotation judy">(Scott) - Annabella's sister</span></p>
