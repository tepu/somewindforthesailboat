        <p class="noIndent">My Dear Child,</p>
        <p>I take this opportunity of letting you know that we are all in tolerable good health at present thanks be to the Almighty for all his mercies to us. I am suffering very much by the sore that is on my leg, but your Sister <span class="annotation judy">[Elizabeth]</span> and family are all in good health. I hope you will not delay in letting me have an answer to this as soon as you can, and let me know what that 10£ make in your money in that Country, as it is most likely that it may be the last you will get from me, my age and this sore that is on me may take me away sooner than expected.</p>
        <p>I hope you will make good use of what I now send you.</p>
        <p>Your sister and family joins me in their best wishes to you and Family.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">I remain yours affectionate</br>Mother Ann Scott</p>
