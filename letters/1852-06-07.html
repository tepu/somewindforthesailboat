        <h2>Drimurie 7th, June 1852</h2>
        <p class="noIndent">My Dear Annabella,</p>
        <p>I am in receipt of your letter written the 26th April which finds me in my usual state of health, a day older and a day nearer to the grave. My leg still remains bad and very disagreeable to me but this side of the grave I expect no improvement. May the Lord in his great mercies prepare us to meet in a happy eternity where trouble and trials will no more gaze us in the face.</p>
        <p>It leaves us all quite unhappy to hear of your bad health, also Mary and Henry <span class="annotation judy">[Annabella, Mary and Henry ill]</span>. In respect to Annabella, she remains still in the same way, mindful of nothing <span class="annotation judy">[insane]</span>. Your Brother <span class="annotation judy">[in law]</span> Winslow has almost quite lost the use of his legs from pain and a weakness in his back. Your sister Eliza's health is only middling. She is a good deal worse. As for their children, they are going on pretty well, Francis still lives in Lurga has four children, one son - three daughters. Essy Ann's family is well. She has nine children, four sons and five daughters. Charlotte, her family is well, she has got 2 sons and two daughters and will soon have another (GW). There is no change among the other friends worth mentioning.</p>
        <p>There has not been a better season in Ireland these fifty years past. This last winter and spring crops look in general remarkable good. Provisions is plenty here and at moderate price, oat meal 10c per cwt, India meal 8c per cwt, potatoes 3c per cwt. If there comes no blight on our potatoes crop this year we will want none of your Indian meal flour or pork <span class="annotation judy">[Ireland bought Indian corn and pork from Canada]</span> in future. We are likely to have a very  - - - - <span class="annotation ben">[sic]</span> general election in Ireland about the first of July next. Lord Derby our new prime minister wants a few Bible reading members from Ireland to assist in taking care of the College of Ministry and also to assist him in expelling from the United Kingdom of England superstition <span class="annotation judy">[Catholic religion]</span> - - - - <span class="annotation ben">[sic]</span>, the reformation, and to put away such as Cardinal wise man and his red stockings. I suppose you heard of him in England. We got good ministers in Newton Forbes. They lecture once a fortnight in Winslow's.</p>
        <p>May the Lord bless to us what we hear and grant through his great mercies, as we can never meet in this world that we may meet in a better world.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Winslow & Eliza and their children remain in love to you and your families and remain your affectionate Mother,<br>Anne Scott</p>

        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">The Winslow mentioned in this letter is Winslow Scanlon. He married Elizabeth Scott, sister of Mrs. Michael Ogletree <span class="annotation judy">(Annabella)</span>. A son and daughter of Francis Scanlon went to Australia and kept a draper's, or a store as we would say. Grandfather and Francis Scalon were first cousins on his mother's side and were named after their Grandfather Francis Scott. They corresponded. There is one letter here from him written about 1873. He mentions some of John Ogletree's family, James and William. William was a married man and was leaving for the united states to his mother's people <span class="annotation judy">(Catherine)</span>.</p>
