        <h2>Drimure 10th July, 1854</h2>

        <p class="noIndent">My Dear Annabella,</p>
        <p>I take this opportunity of corresponding with you, hoping it may find you and family in good health, as we are at present, thanks be to almighty God for all his blessings to us.</p>
        <p>But dear sister, I have to announce to you the death of Dear Mother, which of course although distant, will penetrate your feeling and leave you lonesome as it has left me. She died on the fourth of April last <span class="annotation judy">[3 months ago! Anne Scott died April 4th, 1854]</span>, and in her illness which was a length of time, she was for three months unable to leave her bed without assistance, and for ten months before, nigh as helpless.</p>
        <p>She was during her long illness attended most attentively by that excellent and God fearing minister the Rev. Mr. Digby, and his curate who attended her remains to its last home and preached a sermon adequate to the age and departure out of this life of that dear and affectionate mother. Dear to my memory while I shall live were I at the age of 16 and to live to the age she was. My health is pretty good and much better than I expected after the long fatigue and loss of rest I have. Winslow is not getting worse, although still delicate, Francis & family are well and doing very well, and also Essy Anne and Charlotte and their families. There are many occurrences here that would be interesting to a person lately leaving this country, but you being so long absent, it would be useless to mention them to you <span class="annotation judy">[had been gone 23 years]</span>. Dear sister, on receipt of this, answer it as soon as possible, as I will be uneasy to hear from you and family, and remain till death your affectionate sister.</p>
        <p class="annotation ochillila">Elizabeth Scanlon to Mrs. Annabella Ogletree.</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochillila">This letter is addressed to
            </br>Mrs. Annabella Ogletree
            </br>Howard, North America
            </br>Upper Canada West
        </p>
        <p class="annotation ochillila">Stamped</p>
        <p class="annotation ochillila">Paid 8d. to Destination, also Newton Forbes July 17th 1854. There is one other stamp July 18, but I can't make it out. One other mark looks like Morpeth U.C. which I think means Upper Canada. I came across this letter lately, and I did not remember copying it for you, and as it tells of Ann Scott's death, and gives the date quite clearly, I thought I would send it. She was our, that is, she was my Great Great Granmother, maybe you need another great. It's rather confusing, but it is sort of interesting to be reading letter, 111 years old, from a relative in Ireland. This is a funny Christmas letter, except for a historian. I was very busy in the Fall and too tired to write, but now I am having eye trouble. It's getting better now, we are all as well as we will be I guess, we are able to keep going, so that's something. Will have to close this and get supper. Remember me to Clara and the ones I haven't met.</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochillila">Wishing you all a Happy Christmas and New Year,</br>Ochililla</p>
