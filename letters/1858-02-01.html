        <p class="noIndent">Dear Sister, <span class="annotation judy">Annabella Ogletree</span></p>
        <p>I send you these few lines hoping to find you and your children and grandchildren in good health as this leaves me and my husband Winslow, and all my children and grandchildren. We have very bad report in this country from America for the last three months of banks closing, and causing great disaster to trade and commerce, throwing so many out of employment and of course throwing them a burden on the public purse. I hope that you and your children have not met with any loss through these failures of banks or through their results.</p>
        <p>There has been no failure of banks in Ireland with very few exceptions, but in England and Scotland the papers in this country gave an account that there was failures in banks to the amount of fifty millions, which greatly reduced our prices in provisions and put a stop nearly to business for some time. However, at present there is a great amendment in prices of provisions and in every way. Wheat at present 22 shillings per barrel, 27 stone oats 11 shillings per barrel, 16 stone potatoes 2 s. 6d. per cwt., 8 stone butter 9d per lb., beef from 4d to 7d per lb., bacon 7d to 9d per lb.</p>
        <p>We have frightful accounts in this country of atrocities committed in India upon women and children and, in short, all the Europeans who fell into their hands.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">I am expecting an immediate answer. I remain your affectionate sister,<br>Elizabeth Scanlon</p>
