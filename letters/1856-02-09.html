        <h2>Drimure 9th February, 1856</h2>

        <p class="noIndent">Dear Annabella <span class="annotation ochililla">[from sister Elizabeth]</span>,</p>
        <p>I send you these few lines hoping to find you and all your children and grandchildren in good health as this leaves me and all my children and grandchildren in at present, thanks be to God for it.</p>
        <p>My eldest daughter Essy Anne has twelve children alive. My son Francis has six children, my daughter Charlotte has five children.</p>
        <p>The lease of my land was dropped last year and I have again taken it at one shilling per acre more. We paid 24 shillings per acre before, we have it now at 25 shillings per acre. As this Russian war has cuased provisions and every commodity very dear in this country, beef 6d. per lb. butter one shilling per lb. Bacon 8d. per lb. Wheat 2 Â½ 4 shillings per barrel 20 stone oats 16s. per barrel. Potatoes 3/3d. per Cwt. but there is such rumours of peace or the war being settled that provisions and every commodity is likely to get a great fall.</p>
        <p>I am expecting that you will let me know in your answer how you and all your children and grand children are and how they are doing. My partner in life <span class="annotation judy">[husband]</span> is getting greatly better of the rumeatism pains and getting greatly to the use of his limbs, thanks be to God for it. I am also expecting that you will send me some token that will keep you in my remembrances and take with me to my last resting place, say a ring of your hair. I remain your affectionate Sister.<p>
