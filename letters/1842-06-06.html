        <h2>Hulcum 6th Jun, 1842</h2>
        <p>Dear Brother, I now commence to write. I have oft done before, and I suppose it will be in vain, but if I get no answer this time I never intend to write again.</p>
        <p>Dear Brother, I have changed my life since I saw you. I have got married to a daughter of James Dobson of Tauneymore. I have two men children and Catherine her and I joins and sends our love to you and Pappy & Ann and the whole family.</p>
        <p>I know of my friends that I now mention to you. Your mother-in-law and Winslow Scanlan & family are all well, and your mother-in-law <span class="annotation ochilila">[Mrs. Francis Scott]</span> is uneasy that she can’t get a letter from you, and I request that on the receipt of this letter that you ill write to her – Wilson Scot told me before his death that she would equally divide her cash between her daughters, and she’s been in Mohill some time ago and she told Mr Gallighan that if she knew where to direct, that she would write to you. She drew her money from Mr Norris and lodged it again to the amount of £800. I think that it becomes your duty to write to her as soon as possibly you can.</p>
        <p>The poor woman had like to be burned to death. She left the family in the county Longford and took lodging in Mohill. Being alone one day in the house, and at her kitchen fire, her clothes took fire and only for the help of Anne's son that was working convenient she would be lost. She is now living with the family in the county Longford Roscommon. To give you a short account of the State of Ireland crime and outrage are nightly increasing. They shot Mr. McClandes west of Cloone, and many others that won’t I be too tedious to mention. Upstarts would shoot a man for a bottle of whiskey – they are taking an inventory of Ireland at the present of everyman’s quantity of land, stock and fowls, and the poor laws are established in Ireland, there is a poorhouse abuilding in Mohill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norris was surprised that I could get no answer from you, and I never paid rent, but he inquired about you and still told me to continue writing until I would get an answer now, as this goes by hand you have no excuse. Patt Murray requests you will send him an account about Walter Haloray, his son-in-law is he in that country or did he go to United States? the reason why that he is uneasy is his son is gone out to new york this season. The rates of commodities – potatoes <span class="unknown">?</span> £ per ct- .</p>
        <p>John Shaw <span class="annotation judy">[Annabella’s grandfather?]</span> of Cloon -- is dead and buried. The late Lord Clemments is dead and buried – Thomas Norris Esquire is living in your Father-in-law’s former house - - - - - - John Sickles Junior succeeds Wilson Scott in the Clerkship of Mr Norris. Ireland is a poor, different place, and a man with tolerable means may thank God to be out of it.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">No more at present but remains your affectionate Brother to Death.
        </br>John Ogiltree</p>
