        <h2>Drimure 29th July, 1842</h2>

        <p class="noIndent">My Dear Son & Daughter</p>
        <p>You blame me in not writing to you. I never received a letter but the one I now take the opportunity of answering which I only received on Sunday last which gives me the happiness of hearing of your welfare both in health and in the comfort you enjoy in a foreign land.</p>
        <p>As the Almighty has been so kind to spare your aged mother which never can be thankful enough for his mercies to me. Of course my age must cause you to think that my time will not be long in this world, but I hope the Almighty will spare me a little time longer, that I may be able to settle my affairs in this world hoping we all may meet in the world to come in the presence of the Almighty where there is joy and blessing for ever more but my Dear Child I do not intend to leave this world without thinking of you as my child although you are far away you may expect a child's part as well as your sister.</p>
        <p>My Dear Child I still remain with your sister and find them all very kind an affectionate to me. I hope you not blame me in not writing, I would have wrote if I had known where to write to, but now I hope you will not neglect in answering as soon as possible, as I see letters coming here in less <span class='unknown'>?</span> a month. You know it will be a pleasure to me as long as I am spared in this world to hear from you and your companion <span class='annotation judy'>[husband]</span>, I wonder you have not mentioned anything about your children, altho Henry promised when he was going that he would write to me, but he has forgot me I suppose - Anne Scott</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Dear Brother and sister,</p>
        <p>Betty <span class='annotation judy'>[Elizabeth]</span> and I feel very happy to hear you all are in good health as we are at present. Thanks be to God for all his mercies to us. Dear Mick, I need not write much about England <span class="annotation ochililla">[Ireland?]</span> I think you know it very well, we had some tryles but I hope it neer over, Betty and I and family joins in love to you and your family — I remain your Sincere brother <span class='annotation judy'>[in-law]</span>,</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Winslow Scanlon</p>
        <p>I will now gives you a little account of the country and am sorry to say that it is not the best. The minds of people are not as we were formerly. They are too much of agriation <span class='annotation ben'>[agréation?]</span> in some of the Liberal party for since the Criest has taken such part in Elections the poor misguided people are so much blinded by that brings them into error with the <span class='unknown'>?</span> out of Readdy.</p>
        <p>The provisions are pretty smart in this country. Wheat is 30 to 34 per barrel, and oats from 12 to 13 per barrel. That is all I can say respecting the country. I now conclude by praying to the Almighty for a blessing on you and your family. Your sister and family joins me in this. Best wishes to you also, I remain your affectionate mother</p>

        <p class="annotation ben"> NOTE: There are drawings included that should be scanned</p>
        <p class="annotation ochililla">This letter is addressed to Mrs. Micheal Ogletree, Brockville, Upper Canada North, via Liverpool</p>
        <p class="annotation ochililla"> These letters, one from Anne Scott to her daughter and son-in-law and a note to them from Winslow Scanlon in between the start and finish of Anne Scott's letter, I have the impression that neighter writers are very well as in one line they mis-spell and repeat as if very tired and then spell right and write in a wrong way, though in other letters they don't do that. In this letter the spelling is bad, but in most of Ann Scott's letters it is so much better. As you will notice in the address the T Ogletree is not crossed and looks like l. Also, I have written a line the way it looks. That I cannot make out. The last line on page two.</p>
        <p class="annotation ochililla">It might be some trouble, Ireland was in a troubled state and it may be something to do with that. Ann Scott had very decided political and religious views and usually comments on the news of the country in her letters, and gives the prices of grain and food, I could not make out the whole letter, it was very hard to copy, some faded, she was a very good writer, and usually very clear, and a lot of them are of a later date than this one. This is one of the earliest dated ones from Ireland. Ann Scott was quite well off. I do not think her husband was a farmer, but the Scanlons were. I copied three last Sunday, but will not get more than one this time. This letter like most of them the letter is folded to form an envelope so it hasn't the protection of an envelope on its travels, and when one thinks how far it came first to Brockville, then to Thamesville, then to Portage then out to McDonald on Burnside, then back to Portage, then to High Bluff, then to Portage again for Grandpa to read, then back to High Bluff again, and it is 123 years old, hope you can make it out.</p>
