        <h2>Howard, December the 22nd 1844 <span class="annotation ochililla">In Howard Township</span></h2>


        <p>My dear brother in Christ Jesus our lord, I now sit down to write to fulfill my promise of your looked for letter, and while I do so, I hope to be pardoned for procrastinating the time but as Festus said to Agrippa, I had nothing of satisfaction to write either for myself or you until now, thank my kind redeemer that we are all well we arrived here I believe on the fifteenth of November after journey of two weeks or better. Our journey would not have been so long were it not for the fog on the river.</p>
        <p>My Dear brother if this reaches your aged hands, I favourably hope that it will find you and mother and all the family in state of good health, both in soul, and body, and that the health of the soul is increasing as fast as the body is decreasing.</p>
        <p>O my brother look to him who is able and willing to give you the victory through the blood of the lamb. Don’t let the devil cheat you out of the Crown of glory that is treasured up for you and all them that seeks him. Go forward in the strength of the lord, he holds scepter out to you daily, lay hold on it by faith in his blood, through evil as well as good, report a few more risings and settling suns seems will end your mortal career, and your disembodyed spirit shall take to flight to the regions of eternal bliss there to behold him whom you love and are here in atonement of clay which may the lord grand for his name and mercy sake.</p>
        <p>As it respects the state of my mind when I came here, I was very much dissatisfied with the place, as the account I received of the goodness of the land from some people by their talk, you would not find one bad lot in this part, but that the land in general was as good as William Corners, and which is either a mistaken idea or a flat lie, for there is no land here to surpass his land in any way whatever. It is certain there is as good, but they are fewest in number. However, the land here is far preferred to where I lived in your settlement. The land is all of a sandy nature, just where our people lives: but three miles from them there is as good clear land as I even saw, land I am told is under cultivation this fifty years, and I have been a witness to as strong wheat stubble on it as even I saw in Kittey at any time. Straw sufficient for fifty bushels to the acre, were it not for the rust which <span class="unknown">?</span> nearly as bad here as it did there. Some of the land here rates very high. One man told me he was offered three thousand dollars for his hundred acres when there was no frame buildings on it, and according to that is now four.</p>
        <p>There is a great depth of muck where our people live, except on the highest land, which is not as profitable at present but much more so when cleared and ploughed than the high land on account of the duration of its richness. It is extraordinary to see the multitude of potatoes they raised off a small piece of land, oats and corn unusually strong to consider the time of planting. There is a beautiful country from this place to Chatham, twenty miles from here, situated on the bank of the Thames.</p>
        <p>The greatest quantity of fruit trees I ever saw is in this part especially apple trees, some of them perhaps two feet through, which yield abundance of apples every year. As for the clearing of land here, we can do it as easy as we could there. The timber that grows just here is chiefly beech,then there is large walnuts, white-wood and butter wood, all which are very profitable to the farmer either for sawed lumber or logs. The walnut is some of most valuable timber in America, lumber of the same selling very high. As to respects my settling here, I cannot tell at present. I wrote for land some time ago, and did not receive an answer yet. My Father has one of the best log houses in this part, and he and the family is perfectly satisfied with the change they have made, and in some degree so they ought, for the like winter I never spent in Canada. There is no snow here whatever, and is unusually warm considering the season. This is one great reason why people should be satisfied here. Another great comfort is that I did not see a stone. The size of half an <span class="unknown">?</span> on one of the farms since I came here, and a third satisfaction is there is no thistles here, which must go satisfaction to the farmer. Cattle rates low here. My Father bought a yoke of cattle for $40 to that would weigh 2000 of beef if were fatted I believe. Cows from eight to 12 dollars, wheat from ½ a dollar to 3-1½ per bushel. Flour 2 dollars per hundred, corn 1 10½, and so rates the market.</p>
        <p>Dear brother, I now wish you to remember one with my companion <span class="annotation judy">[wife]</span> to them whom I mention to you, and to you and family, first to our dear brethren and family's Mr. Morison, and to Mr. Hill, may the lord direct his way to happiness to Mr Conner <span class="annotation ochillila">[william (?)]</span> may his grace and faith increase, and to John, a young man that I have a particular regard for and especially to Betsy and her helpers, if any, who supplied my necessity when it was much awanting. Remember me in more than neighbourhood to James Crunmiy and his family, a man which stood by me in the day of trouble without fee or reward. I wish I had such neighbours here, I would feel happy to see Samuel Riley and other enquiring friends.</p>
        <p>My Father and family send their love and best respects to you and all the friends they have parted with in that place. I believe this place would suit a person that can’t buy better than any other.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">Farewell may the lord direct your way to glory is the prayer of your unworthy servant,<br>Henry Ogletree</p>
        <p>I would feel thankful if you would send this letter to Ann’s brother, as I won’t write to him yet.</p>
