        <p>You will answer by return post, direct to Luke Conner. <span class="annotation judy">(Luke Connor & Anne lived near them)</span></p>
        <p class="noIndent">Dear Mother,</p>
        <p>I take this favourable opportunity of writing these few lines to you hoping they will find you, and the families you make a part of, in good health as they leave me in at present. Thanks be to God for all his mercies up to this present time. My companion <span class="annotation judy">(husband, Thomas)</span> has a running <span class="annotation judy">sore</span> on his neck that the doctor's opinion is that he never will get over it. As for the letter that Mr. J. Kirker wrote you was unknown to me. As for the money he said I was in great need of, for it is not money I want, but comfort that I never expect to have. He  <span class="annotation judy">(Thomas)</span> has rented the place and sold off almost all that was on it, and is selling as fast as he can, and as for where he is going to, I can't tell you, for one day he is going to Brockville, and next day is going to Ireland, so I can't tell where I will be settled. Luke <span class="annotation judy">(Connor)</span> and family is well and as for Anne she has not got as good health this long time as she does at present, and further I want to let you know that I was in James Kirker's for two or three days waiting for the money to come down. It was the advice of the people for me to go back and keep the things together, that after the first of January he could not put the place out of his hands. James has come home, but as for how long he may stay I can't tell.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">No more at present but remain your affectionate daughter till death,<br>Elizabeth Boddy.</p>
        <p class="noIndent"><span class="annotation judy">Thomas died 4 months later in April 7, 1851 in Kingston. Elizabeth lived at Latimer's a few years. Elizabeth went west to brother Francis and died 1896 in Portage La Prairie]</span></p>
        <p class="noIndent">Dear Grandmother, <span class="annotation judy">Son of Elizabeth and Thomas. Brothers Thomas and Frank went west</span></p>
        <p>I want to let you know that I am not at home, nor never expect to go there, as I am just after recovering from a long fit of sickness that acted like the ague and fever, and at present living at Uncle Luke's as I am thrown on the wilds of the world to look up a place for myself. I want you to let me know about that place you mentioned in the letter that you sent my mother, as I never intended to settle in this part of the world, for I can't make up my mind to settle here, and if I can make out I intend going to see that part of the country next summer, if I am spared my health.</p>
        <p class="noIndent">No more at present, but remain yours. Affectionate child till Death,<br>Isaac Boddy.</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">This is addressed to Mrs. Annabell Ogletree<br>Howard P.O<br>1/ 1/2 9 W</p>
        <p class="noIndent annotation ochililla">These letters were written on a double sheet of paper. I have copied them to show there was an Isaac Boddy. I think maybe there wasn't a George, so I never heard mother say that name. He may have written Grandchild, but the paper is cut and child is all I could see. Ochililla<p>
